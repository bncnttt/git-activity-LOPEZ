What i've learned about Git and GitHub
- I learned that Git and GitHub makes it easier to manage and keep track of code changes. With Git, I can save different versions of my work and go back if I make a mistake. GitHub also lets me store my projects online and share them with others. It's really helpful for teamwork since everyone can work on the same project without messing up each other's work.
